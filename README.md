# Learning more about webpack

# Getting started

After cloning this directory, run `yarn` to install dependencies

`yarn start:dev` to start development server for the front end on localhost 3000

# Scripts

### `yarn tsc`

Transpiles files from typescript to javascript. Output is in dist/ folder.

### `yarn start:dev`

Starts the development server on localhost 3000 to see live changes on the client side.

## Webpack

- Webpack is a bundler that transforms modules into static assets. It is configured in webpack.config.js.
- The webpack dev server serves the files located in dist at localhost:3000.
